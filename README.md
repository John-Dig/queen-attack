## Technologies Used

* C #
* dotnet

## Description
  It's a chess related tool.  It returns If the queen is able to attack target. Follow the prompt, get your answer.  Coordinates must be entered by numbers for x and y, not traditional chess notation.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "queen-attack/QueenAttack".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.

### Known Bugs
  No bugs, but it could use some work to accept classic chess notation instead of just number coordinates.  Heck, it could use a lot of work and just become a chess game.  It could also be built into an executable.
